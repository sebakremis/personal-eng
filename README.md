# Sebastian Kremis — Personal Page

This repository contains my blog-style personal website. The page is built with static HTML and CSS and presents insights and visualizations created from raw market data extracted with a Python ETL pipeline.

👉 You can view the live site here: [sebakremis.github.io/personal-eng](https://sebakremis.github.io/personal-eng/)

- Blog-style landing article that summarizes professional strengths and interests (AI-generated assessment)
- Sidebar with skills, experience highlights, education, and certifications (links to certificate verification pages)
