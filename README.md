# Sebastian Kremis — Personal Page

This repository contains my blog-style personal website. The page is built with static HTML and CSS and presents insights and visualizations created from raw market data extracted with a Python ETL pipeline ([EquitySquema](https://github.com/sebakremis/EquitySchema) public repo).

👉 You can view the live site here: [sebakremis.github.io/personal-eng](https://sebakremis.github.io/personal-eng/)
